"""
    This is just here as an example of the botsettings.py file that we
    will have on our computers. We don't want to upload this file to the
    repo because it will contain the API token (which is used to allow
    Jarvis to log in/connect to our workspace). Theoretically, if we 
    uploaded the API token to the repo, then evil mysterious hackerZ 
    could use it to log in to our Slack repo and pursue their evil deeds!

    What we will do instead is have this file be on our own computers 
    with the API token so we can run Jarvis successfully without
    comprimising the security of our Slack repo (and triggering Professor
    Bagrow to go on a tangent and deduct points).
